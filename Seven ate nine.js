// Description:
// Seven is a hungry number and its favourite food is number 9. Whenever it spots 9 through the hoops of 8, it eats it! Well, not anymore, because you are going to help the 9 by locating that particular sequence (7,8,9) in an array of digits and tell 7 to come after 9 instead. Seven "ate" nine, no more! (If 9 is not in danger, just return the same array)

// My solution

function hungrySeven(arr){
  let ate = true;
  while(ate){
  ate = false;
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length - 2; i++){
    if(arr[i] === 7 && arr[i + 1] === 8 && arr[i + 2] === 9){
      let [seven] = arr.splice(i, 1);
      arr.splice(i + 2, 0, seven);
      i--;
      ate = true;
    }
    }
    }
  return arr;
}
