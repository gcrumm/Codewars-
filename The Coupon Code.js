// Description:
// Story
// Your online store likes to give out coupons for special occasions. Some customers try to cheat the system by entering invalid codes or using expired coupons.

// Task
// Your mission:
// Write a function called checkCoupon which verifies that a coupon code is valid and not expired.

// A coupon is no more valid on the day AFTER the expiration date.
// All dates will be passed as strings in this format: "MONTH DATE, YEAR".
// For the correct code and the entered code to match, both their values and data types must be the same. This means that e.g. false and 0 are not the same, and neither are 123 and "123".
// Examples:
// ("123", "123", "July 9, 2015", "July 9, 2015")  ===>  true
// (0,  false,    "July 9, 2015", "July 9, 2015")  ===>  false
// ("123", "123", "July 9, 2015", "July 2, 2015")  ===>  false

// My solution

function checkCoupon(enteredCode, correctCode, currentDate, expirationDate) {
    if(enteredCode === correctCode && new Date(currentDate) <= new Date(expirationDate)){
      return true;
    }else{
      return false;
    }
}
